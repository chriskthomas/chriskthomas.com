They say not to turn to an agent or a publisher until you&#8217;ve finished your draft, which means that you have to find your way to the end of a millions winding paths just to get directions that you were supposed to be going the other way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, I\u2019ve had access to plenty of people willing to read what I have so far. I always thought that dedicated sections at the start of books were just for the most important people in the author\u2019s life\u2014a spouse, a dead relative, a really cute dog\u2014but with all the incredible feedback I\u2019ve been getting, it feels like I should dedicate my book to my army of amateur editors. I\u2019ll have to credit it to friends, coworkers, everyone from my college, strangers I met online\u2014by the time it\u2019s finished, half of my book is probably going to have to be the dedicated section.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So really, what I\u2019m trying to say is that a\u00a0<em>lot<\/em>\u00a0of people have read my book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On to the nitty gritty: It&#8217;s a YA fantasy novel\u2014working title: <em>The Extra Children<\/em>\u2014and it&#8217;s going to be the first in a series of at least three books. It feels like most authors find their inspirations in other literature, but my writing draws more on visual arts, from games to comics and shows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ll reveal a lot more about the specifics\u00a0as time goes on, but for now, I&#8217;m planning on using this blog to document my experiences with writing and attempting to publish for the very first time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your support.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s official, I&#8217;m writing a book, but I can still get writer&#8217;s block from a blog post.
